# sanjose README

## Created using https://themes.vscode.one

I found a theme on Xcode called San Jose (made by Pat Murray), and I loved it. I wanted to use the colour palette
on the application that I use for most of my development: VS Code.

I made some variations as Xcode colour coding isn't identical to VS Code, but I think it turned out great.

If anyone comes across it, thanks Pat Murray, not me!
